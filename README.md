#  StudioDanceTracker

The idea of this project came from a personal motivation to support my sisters, who run a dance studio in Brazil. Understanding their requirement for an effective system to handle classes and student information, the **StudioDanceTracker** was created. The app is an application designed for the management of student data and class administration within a dance studio environment.
